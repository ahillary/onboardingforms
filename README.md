A technical challenge to create an interface for a user to input information, aka an onboarding process that includes a series of forms. Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) to fulfill front-end requirements. Bootstrapped with [express-generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) for back-end.

To begin testing:

-download this repository to your local machine

-In the client directory, run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` to start your React-Redux app and view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

-In the server directory, run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` to start your Express app and view it in your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

-In the server directory, run `npm run seed` to seed a database with dummydata for testing.
